**Project Features** 
 
The website needs to run through some authorization. Which we call them as the features. In our project of this NGO (manam) we used some features which will help us to find the right address where we have to look out for. The features we used are, 

Login:  The feature allows users to securely access personal information, services, and features by authenticating their identity through a set of credentials.

Update: The update feature of a website typically refers to functionality which allows the users to modify or revise their account information, preferences, or content they have previously submitted. 

Read: The “read feature” from the database of a website refers to the functionality that allows  users to retrieve and view stored data from the website database. This enables users to access information. Such as articles, profiles of the users or any other content that is stored
 in the database. 
 
Feedback : The feedback feature gives the patients opportunity to contact the NGO through direct messages and share their experience and valuable opinion on the services provided.

Transaction: It refers to the process of conducting the financial transactions or interactions between users and the website’s services. Also often referred to conduct the financial interfaces between exchanging of goods, services and payments.

Statistics: The statistics feature on websites  typically involves collection of money, upgrading of the organizations, analyzing and preparing data related to various aspects of the website’s performances, user behavior, or other relevant information.
